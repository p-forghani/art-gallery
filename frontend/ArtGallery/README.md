###  üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Personal note:
  - This project is the **first** project I have ever done in `React.js`. 
  - I worked on it for a *month*, while learning the most basic topics from the *documentation*.
  - I tried to build the site while maintaining a **responsive design** in different sizes of screens.<br>
  - The most challenging concept was to represent the image cards responsibly so that the amount of columns would be updated according to the screen width, I did this using `column-count` in `css`, as you can see [right here](https://github.com/shir0206/ArtGallery/blob/master/src/ArtGallery/Gallery/gallery.css). 
  - Another challenge I faced was how to plan the hierarchy between the components.
  - I would be happy to recieve [feedback](mailto:shir0206@gmail.com)!
